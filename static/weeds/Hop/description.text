Scrambling perennial (<10 m tall) with extensive roots, and roughly hairy stems with fine ridges. Broadly oval, unlobed or deeply 3-5 lobed leaves have serrated edges, are usually hairless above, and hairless to moderately hairy below with yellow glandular hairs. Male flowers are small, green, hairy, while female flowers are yellowish at fruiting, and form a distinctively smelling cylindric cone (hop) covered with yellow gladular hairs (Jan-Feb). Seeds form Feb-March in a dry husk.
