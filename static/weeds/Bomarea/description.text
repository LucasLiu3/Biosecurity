Multi-stemmed, scrambling, perennial vine that twines around any available support and may die back over winter in frost-prone localities. Stems arise from short underground rhizomes that bear numerous tubers. Leaves are long and pointed, with parallel vines. Tubular flowers range from red to orange or gold on the outside and yellow inside with dark spots, and hang in clusters of 15-20 flowers from summer to winter. Numerous fleshy, round, bright orange fruit develop in a capsule (2 cm diameter) from May to August.
