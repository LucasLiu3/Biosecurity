Perennial climber with woody stout stems that become erect at flowering, attaching to whatever is supporting it with aerial rootlets. Hairless dark green or variegated ivory-white leaves (3-15 cm long) are arranged alternately on stems, and are variably shaped (usually shallowly lobed). Tiny, insignificant yellowish-green flowers (Mar-May) are sometimes followed by purple to black berries (5-8 mm diameter) containing seeds with low viability.
