Perennial, evergreen, climbing, almost hairless, non-woody vine with very long, round, tough, stems that root at nodes. Smooth edged leaves are arranged in opposite pairs on stems, and are divided along the midvein into usually 7 leaflets with the terminal leaflet (<7 x 2.5 cm) the largest. Clustered, tube-like white flowers that are pink when in bud and very fragrant (Jan-Dec), are very rarely followed by glossy black berries (5-8 mm diameter).
