Scrambling or trailing, hairless, aromatic, annual or short-lived perennial, occasionally climbing to 2 m high, with succulent stems (to 10 m long) and watery sap. Distinctive, roundish shield-shaped leaves (18-21 cm diameter) are often slightly asymmetric, bluish underneath and with a long stalk attached to the back of the leaf. Solitary or clustered tubular scarlet orange or yellow flowers (4 cm diameter, Oct-May) with 5 irregular petals are followed by succulent, green, 3-sided seed capsules (10-14 mm long) with caper-like seeds.
