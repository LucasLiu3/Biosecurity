Marginal perennial (occasionally annual) aquatic plant (<2+ m tall) with thick vertical basal rhizomes which produce buds. Soft, spongy 3-sided stems. Strap-like submerged leaves mostly on young plants, with strongly arrowhead-shaped emergent leaves (<25 mm long) on mature plants. Flowerhead is a leafless stem with whorls of 2-12 white flowers (<25 mm diam) with purple patch at base. Male flowers sit on stem above female flowers, and many seeds are produced.
