Plan to control whole areas to minimise reseeding by birds.
1. Dig out small plants (all year round). Leave on site to rot down.
2. Cut down and paint stump (all year round, best in summer-autumn): metsulfuron-methyl 600g/kg (5g /L) or picloram gel. Treat ends of cut branches if they are left on site.
3. Frilling (big stems only in summer-autumn): 'feather' bark, metsulfuron-methyl 600g/kg (5g/L).
4. Spray (summer-autumn): metsulfuron-methyl 600g/kg (5g/L + penetrant).
