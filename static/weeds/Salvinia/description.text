Free-floating fern (<30 cm) with two leaves above the water and one rootlike leaf below. Two leaf types: juvenile leaves well-spaced, small, lying on surface (occasionally only these leaves are produced), while more common rounded mature leaves (1-4 x 1-5cm) are crowded, compacted, folded about the midrib, and the upper surfaces have many rows of water-repellent, basket-like hairs.
