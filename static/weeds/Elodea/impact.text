Can form deep underwater 'meadows', shading out smaller native species and prevents seedlings of native species establishing. Large clumps dislodge from these 'meadows', causing flooding. Rotting vegetation stagnates water, killing fauna and flora. Tends to be replaced by Lagarosiphon or Egeria and other weeds if these are also introduced into the same waterbody.
