1. Dig out with machinery wherever possible. Dry and burn roots and stems or bury deeply.
2. Stump swab (ground level): glyphosate (250ml/L) or a product containing 100g picloram+300g triclopyr/L (undiluted) or picloram gel. Follow up likewise on suckers. Dispose of cut stems at a refuse transfer station, burn or bury deeply to prevent resprouting.
3. Injection (best in autumn): drill holes sloping into the sapwood at regular intervals around the tree. As each hole is drilled place glyphosate (250ml/L) or metsulfuron-methyl 600g/kg (20g/L) or a product containing 100g picloram+300g triclopyr/L (undiluted) into the hole.
4. Frilling: use a sharp chisel or axe and make deep cuts into the sapwood at regular intervals around the base of the tree, taking care not to ring-bark the plant. Immediately apply glyphosate (250ml/L) or a product containing 100g picloram+300g triclopyr/L (undiluted) to the cuts using a paintbrush or a squeeze bottle.
5. Spray: glyphosate (300ml/15L (knapsack) or 2L/100L (spraygun)) or metsulfuron-methyl 600 g/kg (5g/10L on small plants and regrowth). Treatment may need to be repeated.
