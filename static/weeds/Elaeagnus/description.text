Vigorous, dense, evergreen shrub, scrambling over support (<20 m tall), with a very tough, suckering rootstock. Stems are long, arching, tough, with young shoots being brown and scaly and older stems often with spines. Leaves (45-90 x 15-40 mm) are arranged alternately on the stems, are hairless above, and silvery or browny-scaly (often densely) underneath. Small drooping clusters of tiny, whitish, fragrant flowers (Mar-May) are followed by a pale reddish-orange fruit (18 x 10 mm) containing one ribbed seed.
