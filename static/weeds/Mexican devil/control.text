Permanently exclude livestock and control vertebrate pests to allow native species to provide competition for this weed. Interplanting with taller, shade-loving species can help in shady areas, but in open, moderately-lit sites, continuing control will be needed. In low-growing habitats, dense groundcover planting may be necessary. Minimise disturbance as seed bank reinfests bared areas.
