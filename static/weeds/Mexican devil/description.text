Erect, many-stemmed herb to subshrub (<1-2 m) with a perennial fibrous rootstock. Stems often die back in winter, are densely covered in stalked sticky hairs, are usually purple, become woody with age, have branches in opposite pairs, and often have galls which are formed by a parasitic fly. Diamond-shaped leaves (55-80 x 35-70 mm) with irregularly round-toothed edges are in opposite pairs along the stems. Dense clusters of small, white flowers (5-7 mm diameter, Aug-Dec) are followed by 5-angled black seeds (1.8 mm long).
