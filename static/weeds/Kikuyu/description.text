Creeping, perennial, hairy, mat-forming grass with very long stolons that root frequently and occasionally climbing to 2+ m when supported by other plants. Also has long rhizomes. Soft, drooping, bright green to yellow-green leaves (5-40 x 3-9 cm) are alternate, sparsely hairy above and below, have folded blades and a fringe of hairs around the leaf where it wraps around the stem. Pale-green to white sheath has soft hairs (2-4 mm). Seedheads are made up of 2-3 tiny spikelets in upper leaf sheaths, and wispy anthers and stigmas that protrude from leaves.
