Evergreen or semi-deciduous, spiny, yellow-wooded shrub (<4-5 m). Tough, woody steams have yellowish-grey bark and very sharp, hard, single or three pronged spines (<23 mm long) where the leaves meet the stem. Leathery leaves (25-75 x 10-25 mm) with usually serrated edges often turn reddish in autumn. Clusters (<6 cm long) of smelly yellow flowers (5-7 mm, Oct-Nov) are followed by oval, reddish-black berries (7-12 mm) with a dusty white look to them and dark red juice (Mar-May).
