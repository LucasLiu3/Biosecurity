Bushy, evergreen tough shrub (<90 cm tall) with woody, wiry stems and densely hairy young shoots becoming hairless as they mature. Long dark green to brown leaves (1.5-3.5 mm long) are in opposite pairs on the stem, overlapping in four vertical rows. Bell-shaped, pink to pale purple flowers (2-4 mm long) on narrow, leafy, elongated, upright clusters (2-9 cm long, Dec-Mar) are followed by tiny, round, hairy seed capsules.
