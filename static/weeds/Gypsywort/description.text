Erect perennial herb (<1m tall) with creeping rhizomes and square stems. Mint-like leaves (3 x 8.5cm) are dark green, opposite, deeply toothed and prominently veined, but donâ€™t have a mint smell. Tiny white to pale pink/purple flowers (Dec-Mar) are clustered where leaves join stems, and form minute seeds (nutlets).
