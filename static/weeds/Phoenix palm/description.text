Large palm (<18 m tall) with single, thick, non-branching trunk (1.2 m diameter) with a diamond-shaped pattern from old leaf scars and large crown of foliage at the top of the trunk. Long, stiff leaves (<1.8 m) are made up of many leaflets that are dark green, lance-shaped and pointed (30-45 cm long), and the leaf stalk is covered with sharp, shiny green spines (5-8 cm) with a feathery appearance. Branched clusters of creamy yellow-white flowers open from a husk-like structure (Oct-Nov) on a long stem amongst the leaves, and are followed by fleshy, date-like fruit (1-5 cm long), ripening from orange-yellow to dark purple in summer.
