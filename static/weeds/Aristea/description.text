Evergreen, iris-like perennial (<45 cm tall) with woody rhizomes. Sword-shaped, linear leaves (40 cm x 1 cm) are mostly folded in fans with reddish-purple bases that emerge directly from rhizomes, but sometimes leaves can grow from the flattened, slightly winged stems. Numerous loose clusters of 5-7 very fragile deep blue flowers (2 cm diameter) only appearing in bright sunlight (Oct) develop into grooved seed capsules (2 cm long) containing flat, dark red-brown seeds.
